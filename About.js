          HOBBIES
        </h2>
        <p>I have a deep passion for creative expression, with a particular focus on photography, painting, and essay writing. Photography allows me to capture the beauty of everyday moments and translate them into powerful visual stories. Through painting, I explore colors and textures, bringing to life my imagination on canvas. Essay writing helps me articulate my thoughts on various topics, enhancing my communication and critical thinking skills. These hobbies fuel my creativity and provide a well-rounded perspective, which I apply to both my personal and professional life.</p>
