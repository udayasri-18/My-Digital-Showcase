                <p> I am a highly organized and motivated recent graduate with a strong foundation in front-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have developed a robust skill set in Java and Python, which allows me to create efficient, scalable solutions across different domains. My expertise in MySQL gives me a solid understanding of database management and backend operations, making me capable of building and maintaining complex systems that store, manage, and retrieve data effectively.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                With a passion for continuous learning, I have worked on several projects that allowed me to apply my skills in real-world scenarios, from developing dynamic web applications to implementing machine learning algorithms. I am particularly strong in translating business requirements into technical solutions, ensuring that the final product is user-friendly, efficient, and meets business goals.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                I am eager to find entry-level opportunities where I can leverage my technical expertise, problem-solving abilities, and attention to detail to contribute to the success of a forward-thinking company. My goal is to apply my knowledge, enhance my skills further, and grow professionally while helping the organization achieve its objectives.</p>
